<h1>BUILDING A SNOWMAN IN <span class="totalsteps"></span> STEPS</h1>
<div class="steps">
  <p class="welcome">
    This is for anyone who has not yet lived in a place where it snows. </p>
    <p class="welcome">
      Since you haven't done it yourself, we will teach you how to build a snowman in just <span class="totalsteps"></span> steps.</p>
  <p class="welcome">
    It really isn't hard. </p>

<ul>
  <li id="step1">
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>SHAPE BODY OF SNOWMAN</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="images/step_1_snowballs.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>Most snowmen have only three balls that make up the body: the largest one goes on the bottom, the medium one goes in the middle, and the smallest, which is the head, goes on the top.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="step2">
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>PLACE BUTTONS ON BOTTOM TWO MOUNDS</h3>
    <p>
    <img src="images/step_2_buttons.png" alt="">
    Most snowmen have three buttons on each mounds of its body, excluding the head.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="step3">
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>PLACE CHARCOAL BITS ON FACE</h3>
    <p><img src="images/step_3_charcoal.png" alt="">
    The charcoal bits will make up the eyes and the mouth.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="step4">
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>PLACE CARROT ON FACE</h3>
    <p><img src="images/step_4_carrot.png" alt="">
    The carrot is going to be the nose. This is very important, as it's one of the most distinguishable elements of a snowman.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="step5">
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>PLACE HAT ON TOP</h3>
    <p><img src="images/step_5_hat.png" alt="">
    Top hats are popular choices for snowmen. Beanies also work.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="step6">
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>PLACE TWIGS ON MIDDLE</h3>
    <p><img src="images/step_6_twig.png" alt="">
    This step is also important because it's the final touch to complete the body of the snowman. Two twigs have to be placed on both sides of the middle mound. They will be the snowman's arms.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="end">
  If you followed all the steps, then your snowman should look great for the holidays!</p>
<p class="end">We hope you learned something new!
